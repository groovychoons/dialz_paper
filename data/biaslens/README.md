## Bias Lens

This dataset comes from the paper *Benchmarking Bias in Large Language Models during Role-Playing*. You can find the paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00585) and the dataset on [GitHub](https://github.com/LLMBias/BiasLens).

The questions were automatically generated by LLMs and used to test how role-playing scenarios affected answers. We use questions from the dataset without the role-playing element and evaluate the answers using human annotation.
